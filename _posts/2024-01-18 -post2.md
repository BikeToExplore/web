# How I have trained
I have been training constantly since I decided to race TCR in August, but it took a bit of time to find out how. I tried a few generic programs before I eventually decided to buy my own lactate meter and make my own training plan and strategy.

I have spent quite some time fine-tuning everything. At first, I planned a whole month at a time, but that was just a waste of time. I ended up being too ambitious, as the plan was based on "perfect conditions." This type of training mix was also new to me, so I had no idea how well I would recover and how much volume I could handle. 

Now I plan one week at a time, sometimes day by day. Each session is programmed to progress from the previous one, unless it's an easy day. As long as I have a strategy and goal with the training block, this seems to work fine.

My main focus is to always have progress in my intervals. I usually don't plan an interval that does not progress from the last one. If progress is not possible, I will just do an easy ride and save my legs. I adjust. 

I have a minimum of one rest day a week. This rest day is just as much a mental rest day as a physical rest day. I also reduce the volume to about half every fourth week. So three weeks with full training, then one easier week.

I train strength 2-3 times a week. I tried 3 times a week at first, but it was too much and I struggled to progress with my bike intervals. So I adjusted it to 3 times one week, 2 times the week after, and so on. That quickly helped, and it seems my legs finally got enough time to recover. If needed, I will also only do one strength session during my rest week.

I have also adjusted how I train strength in the gym. I stopped training to failure and reduced my reps and the number of sets (on leg exercises). I add weight every time 5-6 reps feel too easy. I then usually start with 3-4 reps with the new weight. If I have a good day, I might do more sets, but I don't increase reps. If I feel extra tired one day, I might swap out the deadlift with leg press or other machines. It just feels safer to push myself on a machine when I'm tired.

The problem with being a cyclist in the gym is that you have the aerobic capacity and endurance to do so many sets close to max (leg exercises). It's easy to just do "one more" and end up overdoing it. It's like with interval training; you should quit before you empty the tank. You should always be able to do one more interval at least. If I feel I can go on and on, I know it's time to add more weight and reduce the number of reps.

As my legs are getting more used to the fatigue from strength training, I have started to experiment a little with a double session on the weekend. First, a strength session in the morning, then intervals in the evening, usually high-torque tempo intervals. I try to do 2-3 tempo sessions a week, some at high torque, others at natural cadence. The sessions are starting to get really long as I'm currently working on increasing the duration in the zone and not power. So I might try to add a little more power (but still tempo power) to some sessions, just to mix it up.

One of my favorite tempo sessions is one where I will combine different power levels and cadences but always stay in the tempo power range. For example, one will be 40min x2 tempo intervals, where the first 20min is 190w and the last is 180w. The next session I will progress with something like 50min x2 tempo, where I will do 30min at 190w, and 20min at 180w. This way I can be more creative with how I progress, and it makes the progress steps smaller but more frequent. I will usually do the lower power with lower cadence. Most importantly, it makes the sessions more fun. It's important to mix things up to not get bored and burned out, especially when all my sessions are inside on Zwift.

I am also slowly adding more volume week by week. This currently happens naturally as my interval duration increases. I try to add volume by making my already long sessions longer, as I want to keep my shorter sessions short (max 2 hours).


# Progress so far



## Muscular endurance and aerobic threshold (LT1)
Progress seems slow if I only look at the numbers, but I can feel the difference in muscular endurance already.

Tempo intervals at 80 rpm feel a lot easier. I used to do all rides in my 1x8 or 1x9 gears, now all rides are 1x10 or 1x11. When I do go back to my natural cadence (90 rpm), and I have a good day, 190w suddenly feels like spinning, almost as if I'm not pushing on the pedals at all. I still struggle with intervals at 200w, though, which is something I will start doing more of as my LT1 seems to have increased a little.

I have been doing some lactate measurements, but it's not always easy to compare and see progress. I know I did the testing wrong the first time (lactate strip touched my finger), but since then I have been getting better.

There seem to be a few changes, however. My baseline seems to have gotten lower, and my LT1 has improved a little. It is now around 170w, which feels correct. Here are all my measurements from the last few months:
